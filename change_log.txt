- Added the gravityflow_columns_status_table filter to allow the columns to be filtered on the status table.
- Updated the note for expired steps to include the step name.
- Updated step conditional logic to support rules based on entry meta and properties.
- Updated the User and Role type fields so the step conditional logic rule value will use the choice drop down instead of text input.
