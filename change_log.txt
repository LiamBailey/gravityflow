- Added the workflow note field to the quick actions in the inbox. The note field is only displayed when required by the step settings.
- Added support for editable fields on the User Input step with calculations based on non-editable and/or non-display fields.
- Updated the note for expired steps to include the step name.
- Updated step conditional logic to support rules based on entry meta and properties.
- Updated the User and Role type fields so the step conditional logic rule value will use the choice drop down instead of text input.
- API: Fixed an issue with the add-on slug which prevents feed interception for third party add-ons.
